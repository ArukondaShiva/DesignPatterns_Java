The Repository design pattern is a commonly used pattern in software development for managing data persistence and retrieval.
It provides an abstraction layer between the application logic and the data storage mechanism, allowing for separation of
concerns and improved code maintainability.

Above Example:
In the example above, we define the UserRepository interface that declares the methods for finding, saving, and deleting users.
Then, we provide two implementations: DatabaseUserRepository for interacting with a database and InMemoryUserRepository for storing users in memory.

Clients of the repository can depend on the UserRepository interface without being concerned about the underlying storage mechanism. 
They can switch between different implementations easily without affecting the rest of the codebase.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you may need to handle exceptions, implement additional methods,
or use a dependency injection framework to manage the repository dependencies.
